# musicELo

This program uses the Elo rating system to rank songs based on user comparisons. Each song is assigned an initial Elo score of 2500. When two songs are compared, their Elo scores are updated according to the outcome of the comparison. The program allows you to perform various actions related to song rankings as well as input songs from soundcloud.
